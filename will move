            meditates<br />

            Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or
            stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers, But his
            delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day
            and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of watwer, which
            yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever
            he does prospers. Not so the wicked! They are like chaff that the
            wind blows away.Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
            nor sinners in the assembly of the rightous. For the LORD watches
            over the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked will
            perish.

            Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain? The kings
            of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against
            the LORD and against his Anointed One. "Let us break their chains,"
            they say, "and throw off their fetters." Then One enthroned in
            heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them. Then he rebukes them in his
            anger and terrifies them in his warth,saying,"I have installed my
            King on Zion, my holy hill." I will proclaim the decree of the LORD
            :He said to me,"You are my son ; today I have become your Father.
            Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of
            the earth your possession. You will rule them with an iron scepter ;
            you will dash them to pieces like pottey." Therefore, you kings, be
            wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth. Serve the LORD with fear
            and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son,lest he be angry and you be
            destroyed in your way,for his warth can flare up in a moment.
            Blessed are all who take refuge in him.
