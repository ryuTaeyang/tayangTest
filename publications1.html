            Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain? The kings
            of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against
            the LORD and against his Anointed One. "Let us break their chains,"
            they say, "and throw off their fetters." Then One enthroned in
            heaven laughs; the Lord scoffs at them. Then he rebukes them in his
            anger and terrifies them in his warth,saying,"I have installed my
            King on Zion, my holy hill." I will proclaim the decree of the LORD
            :He said to me,"You are my son ; today I have become your Father.
            Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of
            the earth your possession. You will rule them with an iron scepter ;
            you will dash them to pieces like pottey." Therefore, you kings, be
            wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth. Serve the LORD with fear
            and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son,lest he be angry and you be
            destroyed in your way,for his warth can flare up in a moment.
            Blessed are all who take refuge in him.</span
